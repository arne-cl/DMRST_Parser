In the interview at his home in Balmoral, Prince Charles said action such as blocking roads "isn't helpful".
But he said he totally understood the "frustration" climate campaigners felt.
And he warned of a "catastrophic" impact if more ambitious action isn't taken on climate change.
Speaking in the gardens of his house on the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire, the prince said it had taken too long for the world to wake up to the risks of climate change. 
And he worried that world leaders would "just talk" when they meet in Glasgow in November for a crucial UN climate conference.
